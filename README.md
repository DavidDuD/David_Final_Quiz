# David_Final_Quiz

This is the final project for our class Advanced-Critical-Computation.

Our last project is about using older HTML/CSS concepts such as DOM elements: input, forms, and buttons, and newer Javascript concepts like localStorage, to create an interactive quiz or tool. This quiz or tool should center a specific group/demographic/community and providing some kind of experience or opportunity to the group. 

I care about health and exercise a lot, so I create a simple quiz that allows people who also share similiar interest as I do to test if they have a healthy day by completing the questions in the quiz at the end of the day. The quiz will then anaylzes the answers that users chose, and classified how healthy user is today into three category(You need to take better care of yourself, You did OK today, and You have a healthy day).
